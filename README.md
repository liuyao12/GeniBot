# GeniBot
a multi-tasking bot on Geni.com (using Geni API), a collaborative geneology site (or as I prefer, a wikipedia of the entire humanity).

For the moment, it is purely for my own use from the command line (not error-proof, and at places catered to my personal preferences for entering Chinese names). Anyone is welcome to use on their own, simply by requesting your own access token by logging into Geni, and click https://www.geni.com/platform/oauth/authorize?client_id=382&redirect_uri=a&response_type=token (it will appear in the address bar).

Feedback is most welcomed!

Per Geni policy, I must add that it is NOT in any way endorsed, operated, or sponsored by Geni.

##Things that have been done using this

* Fixing names that are in ALL CAPS or all small, with special treatment to names like McDonald.

* Moving Chinese names into the zh-TW or zh-CN tabs, so they will show up with surname first (and other "special effects" for Chinese names).

* Importing long lists from wikipedia or scholarly databases
** Fellows of the Royal Society
** China Biographical Database (CBDB)
